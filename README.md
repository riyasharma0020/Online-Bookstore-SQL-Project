üìö Online Bookstore SQL Project
üîπ Overview

The Online Bookstore SQL Project is a database-driven project designed to manage a virtual bookstore.
It demonstrates the use of SQL for database creation, management, and querying.

This project focuses on:

Managing books, customers, and orders.

Performing sales analysis.

Tracking customer behavior.

Monitoring inventory and revenue insights.

üóÑ Database Design

The project includes the following core tables:

Books ‚Äì Stores book details (ID, title, author, genre, year, price, stock).

Customers ‚Äì Stores customer information (ID, name, email, phone, city, country).

Orders ‚Äì Tracks purchases, linking customers and books with date & quantity.

Each table has primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to ensure referential integrity.

üöÄ Features & Queries

This project covers multiple SQL use cases, including:

Data Definition (DDL): Creating and managing tables.

Data Manipulation (DML): Inserting, updating, and deleting records.

Data Retrieval (DQL): Querying books, sales, and customers.

Joins & Aggregations: Combining tables for advanced insights.

Reports & Analytics:

Top-selling books.

Customers with multiple purchases.

Monthly and yearly sales reports.

Genre-based revenue contribution.

Inventory tracking and stock updates.

üìù Example Queries

1. Retrieve all books by a specific author

SELECT Title, Published_Year, Price
FROM Books
WHERE Author = 'J.K. Rowling';


2. Find top 5 best-selling books

SELECT b.Title, SUM(o.Quantity) AS Total_Sold
FROM Orders o
JOIN Books b ON o.Book_ID = b.Book_ID
GROUP BY b.Title
ORDER BY Total_Sold DESC
LIMIT 5;


3. Monthly sales revenue report

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', Order_Date) AS Month, 
       SUM(o.Quantity * b.Price) AS Total_Revenue
FROM Orders o
JOIN Books b ON o.Book_ID = b.Book_ID
GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY Month;
